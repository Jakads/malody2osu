# Malody to osu!mania Converter

Converts Malody Key mode charts to osu!mania\
Roughly coded in python by request\
Supports all keys (4K~9K)\
**This project is discontinued and will be merged to [VSRG-Converter](https://github.com/jakads/VSRG-Converter)**

## How to Use

1. **Drag Key Mode .mc files or .mcz/.zip package files into the program.** This will convert all the files you dragged into .osu files in an instant. .osu files will be created right next to .mc files.
2. You can move the files manually if wanted, but **to compress all .osu files into a mapset(.osz), hit any key.**
3. .osz files will be created right next to the .exe. **Run the files** to add the charts to osu!.

## Disclaimer

* This program is tested in **Windows** only. Execution in the other OS's not guaranteed.
* **Expect bugs.** Please report if you ever experience one!
* All the **.mc files** you have dragged in will be compressed into a **single mapset.**
* All the **.mcz/.zip files** you have dragged in will be compressed into **seperate mapsets.** A mapset per file.
* In case of negative SVs, absolute value of the SV value is used for conversion.
* Bare in mind that osu!mania can only interpret SV values between 0.01x and 10x, and any values outside the range are adjusted to 0.01x or 10x by client.\
This might cause some unexpected and possibly disappointing consequences, such as some SV gimmicks in Malody not being converted properly to osu!mania.
