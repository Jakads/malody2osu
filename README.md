# Malody to osu!mania Converter

Windows-only program that converts Malody Key mode charts to osu!mania\
Roughly coded in python by request\
Supports all keys (4K~9K)

## How to Use

1. **Drag Key Mode .mc files or .mcz/.zip package files into the program.** This will convert all the files you dragged into .osu files in an instant.
2. You can move the files manually if wanted, but **to compress all .osu files into a mapset(.osz), hit any key.**
3. .osz files will be created. **Run the files** to add the charts to osu!.

## Disclaimer

* Expect bugs.
* All the .mc files you have dragged will be compressed into a single mapset.
* All the .mcz/.zip files you have dragged will be compressed into seperate mapsets. A mapset per file.
* **Only supports charts with no BPM changes for the time being.** Should really work on that.
* Doesn't support custom hitsounds and SVs yet.

## TODO

* Support folders
* Support custom hitsounds and SVs
* Various color output using Colorama
* More user-friendly GUI using Tkinter... maybe?
