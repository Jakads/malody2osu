# Malody to Osumania Converter
Converts Malody Key mode charts to osu!mania\
Roughly coded in python by request\
Supports all keys (4K~9K)
# How To Use
1. Drag **Key Mode** .mc files into the program. **Dragging .mc files other than Key mode will not work.** This will convert all the files you dragged into .osu files in an instant.
2. You can move the files manually if wanted, but to compress all .osu files into a mapset(.osz), hit Enter.
3. An .osz file will be created. Run the file to add the charts to osu!.
# DISCLAIMER
* Expect bugs.
* All the .mc files you have dragged will be compressed into a single mapset.
* Doesn't support .mcz files yet. Extract it first by dragging into Malody.
* **Only supports charts with no BPM changes for the time being.** Should really work on that.
* Doesn't support custom hitsounds and SVs yet.
# TODO
* Support .mcz files
* Support multiple BPMs
* Support custom hitsounds and SVs...? are they even used
* Automatically ignore non-Key diffs
# VERSIONS
